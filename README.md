## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Well during this small project i had the opportunity in using the useContext hook, which made some things easier.
Also i used Tailwind for the first time during this project, took me a while to get used to it as you have to look up all classes one by one the first few times, buy in the end i am pleased with the result.
